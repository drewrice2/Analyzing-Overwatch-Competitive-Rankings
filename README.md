# Analyzing-Overwatch-Placement-matches

This project sought to analyze the distribution of players' ranks after opening day of Overwatch's competitive mode. The players polled were from reddit.com/r/CompetitiveOverwatch. Over 1,000 responses came in during the first few hours, so a quick analysis method was needed. I threw the data (included in the repo) into a notebook, cleaned the data, and plotted the distribution. I will update the notebook as more responses come in.
